## For All Members

### Dashboard

Your home screen after logging in. Here you'll see:

- **Open Votes** — Votes currently accepting ballots. Each one shows whether you've voted or still need to. Click any vote to cast your ballot.
- **Recent Results** — The latest completed votes. Click to see outcomes.
- **Quick Actions** — Shortcuts to propose a vote, view your history, or (admins) manage votes.

### Casting Your Vote

Click any open vote from the dashboard to see its details and cast your ballot. The voting experience depends on the format:

**Yes / No**
- Click the **Yes** or **No** button. Your vote is recorded instantly.

**Multiple Choice**
- Click the option you prefer. Your vote is recorded instantly.

**Ranked Choice**
- Drag and drop options to rank them from most preferred (#1) to least preferred.
- Click **Submit Ranking** when you're happy with the order.

**Changing your vote:** You can change your vote anytime while the vote is open — just return to the vote page and select a different option.

### Understanding Vote Settings

Each vote has a few key settings visible on its detail page:

| Setting | What It Means |
|---------|--------------|
| **Format** | Yes/No, Multiple Choice, or Ranked Choice |
| **Privacy** | **Anonymous** = fully secret ballot. **Admin-Visible** = admin can see individual votes. **Open** = everyone can see votes. |
| **Quorum** | The percentage of active members who must vote for the result to count (e.g., 75%) |
| **Passing Threshold** | The percentage needed to pass — Simple Majority (>50%), Two-Thirds (≥67%), Three-Quarters (≥75%), or a custom value |
| **Deadline** | When voting closes. Some votes are open-ended and closed manually by an admin. |

### Viewing Results

Once a vote is closed, click it to see the results page. You'll see:

- **Outcome** — Passed, Failed, or Quorum Not Met
- **Quorum check** — Did enough members vote?
- **Threshold check** — Did the winning option meet the required percentage?
- **Vote breakdown** — Bar charts showing how votes landed

For **ranked choice** votes, results show round-by-round elimination until a winner emerges.

### Proposing a Vote

Any member can suggest a vote for the group:

1. Click **Propose** in the top nav (or "Propose a Vote" on the dashboard)
2. Fill in:
   - **Title** (required) — A clear, concise question
   - **Description** (optional) — Context or background
   - **Format** — Yes/No, Multiple Choice, or Ranked Choice
   - **Options** — For Multiple Choice or Ranked Choice, add at least 2 options
   - **Privacy**, **Quorum**, and **Threshold** — Suggest your preferred settings
3. Click **Submit Proposal**

Your proposal goes to an admin for review. They may approve it as-is, adjust the settings, or decline it with a note.

### Voting History

Click **History** in the top nav to see your personal participation record:

- **Participation rate** — Your overall percentage
- **Votes participated** — Votes where you cast a ballot
- **Votes missed** — Votes you didn't participate in

## For Admins

Admins have access to additional pages via the **Admin** link in the top nav.

### Managing Members

**Admin → Members** lets you manage who can access Group Vote:

- **Add a member** — Enter their name and email. They'll be able to log in immediately.
- **Deactivate** — Temporarily removes a member from voting. They won't count toward quorum and can't log in.
- **Activate** — Restores a deactivated member.
- **Remove** — Permanently deletes a member (requires confirmation).

### Reviewing Proposals

**Admin → Proposals** shows proposals submitted by members:

- **Approve & Create Vote** — Creates a draft vote with the proposed settings. You can edit the settings before opening it.
- **Reject** — Declines the proposal. You can optionally add a reason.

### Creating Votes Directly

**Admin → Manage Votes → Create Vote** lets you create a vote from scratch:

1. Fill in the title, description, format, options, privacy, quorum, threshold, and optional deadline
2. Click **Create Vote** — this saves it as a **Draft**
3. Go to the vote's detail page and click **Open Vote** to start accepting ballots

### Opening and Closing Votes

On any vote's detail page, admins see control buttons:

- **Open Vote** — Makes a draft vote live for members to vote on
- **Close Vote** — Ends voting and finalizes results. Members can no longer cast or change ballots.

### Participation Dashboard

**Admin → Participation** shows a table of all active members with:

- How many votes each member has participated in
- How many they've missed
- Their participation rate (color-coded: green ≥75%, yellow 50-74%, red <50%)

Click column headers to sort.
